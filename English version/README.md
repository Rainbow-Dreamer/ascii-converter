# ascii-converter

This is an ASCII art converter I developed on my own, which can convert any pictures and videos to ASCII art images, texts and videos.

You can select the path of the image or video file you want to convert by the system's own file browser box. Support outputting pictures as new picture/text files after conversion. The video will be output directly as ASCII character picture video after conversion (at the same time, it will output each frame of the converted video within the specified frame number) ASCII character pictures in a folder under the path of the software).

You can choose the range of frames you want to convert and the number of frames of the output video, set the scaling ratio and the font type and size of the picture or video frames.

Besides, there are many other parameters that can be set.

You can choose to output colored ASCII pictures and videos.

(2020/12/14 Changes in the latest version: the previous function of displaying character pictures on a new screen was not felt to be very necessary, so it was removed in the current latest version)  
(2021/5/21 I have recently rewritten the whole ASCII art converter, now here is the new version, if you want to download the old version you can [click here](https://www.jianguoyun.com/p/DWBzGQIQhPG0CBidmvUD) to download)
